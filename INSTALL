# After cloning:
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive

Then:

./build -h 
  To see options.

Quick start:

./build init
./build build -c
./build installconf 
  By default, the conf file is installed in ~/.local/share/fish-vol

Now the program should be runnable:

./fish-vol

You can also symlink, for example in /usr/local/bin:

sudo ln -s "$(pwd -P)"/fish-vol /usr/local/bin

The following step is not necessary, but you can use it to install the
libraries and binaries to standard system locations. The main problem with
this approach is that it's difficult to undo (and we don't even try to help
you).

./build install [-p prefix]

  You will probably need sudo, or -p.
